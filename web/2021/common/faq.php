                    <p>Camp is for all youth. Camp costs are typically handled at the ward level. Please discuss specifics and any concerns regarding the cost of camp or camp equipment with your Bishop.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, wards typically organize one fundraiser per year to help offset the costs of camp. Members and parents may participate as they are able, but are under no obligation to do so.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>On Church-sponsored overnight activities, leaders arrange sleeping accommodations so that male and female participants do not sleep in immediate proximity to each other. Male and female leaders must have separate sleeping facilities. Married couples may share the same quarters if appropriate facilities are available.</p>
                    <p>On Church-sponsored overnight activities, a child or youth may not stay in the same tent or room as an adult unless (1) the adult is his or her parent or guardian or (2) there are at least two adults in the tent or room who are the same gender as the children or youth.</p>
                    <p>If adult leaders and children or youth share other overnight facilities, such as a cabin, there must be at least two adults in the facility, and they must be the same gender as the child or youth.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p>We expect all youth to dress modestly and appropriately for camp.</p>
                    <p>Equipment lists are provided for each camp, including what not to bring.</p>
                    <p>However, the equipment lists cannot be expected to cover all items which would be appropriate or inappropriate. As such, consider the following when choosing what to wear:</p>
                    <p>We have been continually counseled to dress modestly. When you are well groomed and modestly dressed, you invite the companionship of the Spirit.</p>
                    <p>Never lower your standards of dress. Do not use camp as an excuse to be immodest.</p>
                    <p>Immodest clothing is any clothing that is tight, sheer, or revealing in any other manner. Young women should avoid short shorts and short skirts, shirts that do not cover the stomach, and clothing that does not cover the shoulders or is low-cut in the front or the back. Young men should also maintain modesty in their appearance. Young men and young women should be neat and clean and avoid being extreme or inappropriately casual in clothing, hairstyle, and behavior. They should choose appropriately modest apparel when participating in sports.</p>
                    <p>If you are not sure what is appropriate to wear, study the words of the prophets, pray for guidance, and ask your parents or leaders for help.</p>

                    <p>Yes. Camp is for you. The purpose of youth camps are to help youth interact with others and have fun. By nature, camp has been designed to be as inclusive as possible but certain considerations may require special attention and adaptation. If you have specific concerns, address them as early as possible with the camp director(s) of your specific event. Also, be sure to mention any considerations while registering. We want to help all youth have an enjoyable experience and participate.</p>
